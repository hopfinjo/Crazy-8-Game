# Crazy-8-Game

I did not write all of this code. All parts of the code I worked on during this assignment are marked in the code. The framework of code was provided by Dr. Jackson my instructor for this class. My tasks were: 
---
Your task for the client is to write the body of the client/presenter/Presenter.js files's request() method. This method will use the Fetch API—calls to fetch() and the json() method of the object returned by fetch()—in order to request information from the server using one of the above forms of URL. Your code will then pass an object representation of the information it receives on to another method for processing. The comments for the request() method provide additional details. You only need to write a few lines of code. 

Your server needs to respond to each of the four types of GET request listed above by extracting the type of request and any parameters from the URL of the request, updating the game state
appropriately, and sending an HTTP response containing a JSON string in the body. This string represents the updated game state and is detailed below. The server must be written using only vanilla Node.js, which includes the HTTP and URL modules we used in class. Do not use any other packages such as ws or Express for this assignment.
